The solution involves checking if `ref.current` is null before attempting to access its properties. This ensures that the code gracefully handles the situation where the element is not yet mounted.  We could also use `useEffect` and the dependency array to assure the code executes after mounting:

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (myRef.current) {
      // Access ref.current after component is mounted
      console.log('Element is mounted:', myRef.current);
    }
  }, [myRef]);

  const handlePress = () => {
    if (myRef.current) {
      // Access ref.current only if it's not null
      myRef.current.focus();
    } else {
      console.log('Reference is not yet mounted');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <TextInput ref={myRef} />
      <Button title="Focus Input" onPress={handlePress} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

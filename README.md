## React Native useRef TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'current')

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `useRef` hook in React Native: attempting to access the ref's `current` property before the referenced element has been mounted. This typically results in a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'current')`.

The `useRefBug.js` file contains the buggy code, illustrating the issue.  The `useRefSolution.js` file shows a corrected implementation that prevents the error.

**Problem:** Accessing `ref.current` before the component has finished mounting leads to `ref.current` being null.

**Solution:** Check if `ref.current` is null before accessing its properties, or use useEffect with a dependency array to ensure execution after mounting.
